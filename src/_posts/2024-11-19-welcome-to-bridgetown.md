Today on my train ride home I finished _Digital Minimalism_ by Cal Newport for the second time. This genre of yuppie self-help is formulaic and windy and is thankfully endagered by the LLM, which can churn out loads of similar pap without needing an advance or an extension.

Why did I read this utterly unremarkable and forgettable book a second time? Two reasons.

My housemates were going to have a reading group on some anti-internet polemic and was the one we picked. (I voted against it.) The reading group never happened, but in preparation for it I read half the book, and my completionist instinct won out.

Also, the message is good, I suppose. Most of the time people spend on the internet is wasted, in the sense that if you ran an RCT on it, you would see little difference in any outcome of interest were their use restricted. Are people better off now that unlimited amounts of porn are free and easily accessible? Or that you can read the news hourly or minutely instead of just daily?

Obviously not! So why do we need a book to tell us this? Human frailty, I suppose.

The book seems unreasonably moderate in certain ways. It suggests spending 30 minutes a week on social media rather than stopping use altogether. It suggests reading "slow news" rather than giving it up altogether. The reality is, 90% of everything is useless, and this is doubly true for the internet. When people go camping they give up all modern conveniences and have a better-than-usual time. During the early pandemic, the entire population was under something akin to house arrest and got only a bit depressed.

I get the sense that Mr. Newport is a hard liner making a soft sell, sort of like Peter Singer advocating for giving rather modest amounts of money to the world's poor in _The Life You Can Save_.

But the book, though it epitomizes a certain sort of mediocrity, is right:

* you don't need apps on your phone (except for phone, camera, maps, and ride-hailing)
* you don't need social media
* you don't need to read the news
