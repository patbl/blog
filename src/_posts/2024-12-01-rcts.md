When a randomized controlled trial contradicts common sense, how should one adjudicate the conflict? Some options are

1. So much the worse for common sense.
2. So much the worse for RCTs.
3. So much the worse for knowing anything.

In the days before the replication crisis, the first option was the hard-nosed position. Studies with counterintuitive results were usually accepted (by the public, at least) at face value. But now we know that some large fraction of scientific research isn't reproducible.

The second option, sticking with the common-sense view, has its own problems. Common sense, depending on how it's defined, might be no more reproducible than scientific studies. Proverbs—common sense distilled—often contradict each other (cf. "opposites attract" and "birds of a feather flock together").

The third option—skepticism—seems most defensible but least helpful.

My housemates heard that rents in Berkeley had fallen and that some renters had negotiated rent decreases. I looked for publicly available sources of rental-market data, and found [the Zillow Observed Rent Index](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/), which showed no recent decrease:

But how relevant is this to whether we can negotiate a rent decrease? I think the stories of tenants negotiating rent decreases are real, and that's not something that the Zillow Observed Rent Index can tell you.
